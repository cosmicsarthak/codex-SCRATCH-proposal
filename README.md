The College Management app is an Application designed to help faculty, and students manage various aspects of a college or university. _It will not require any Administrator Details from the College_.

Some basic features of a College management App would include:

- Student information management `for faculties`
- Course and class management
- Attendance tracking
- Grading and assessment The app may provide tools for teachers to input and track student grades, as well as create and distribute assessments.
- Communication
- Calendar and scheduling
- Fees and payments
